Each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. These reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. We discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. We suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.},

(Standard jackknife theory gives an approximate mean and variance in the case \$R(\textbackslash mathbf\{X\}, F) = \textbackslash theta(\textbackslash hat\{F\}) - \textbackslash theta(F), \textbackslash theta\$ some parameter of interest.) A general method, called the "bootstrap," is introduced, and shown to work satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the bootstrap. The exposition proceeds by a series of examples: variance of the sample median, error rates in a linear discriminant analysis, ratio estimation, estimating regression parameters, etc.},

  abstract = {Poisson regression is a popular tool for modeling count data and is applied in a vast array of applications from the social to the physical sciences and beyond. Real data, however, are often over- or under-dispersed and, thus, not conducive to Poisson regression. We propose a regression model based on the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution to address this problem. The COM-Poisson regression generalizes the well-known Poisson and logistic regression models, and is suitable for fitting count data with a wide range of dispersion levels. With a GLM approach that takes advantage of exponential family properties, we discuss model estimation, inference, diagnostics, and interpretation, and present a test for determining the need for a COM-Poisson regression over a standard Poisson regression. We compare the COM-Poisson to several alternatives and illustrate its advantages and usefulness using three data sets with varying dispersion.},

  abstract = {Summary. A useful discrete distribution (the Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution) is revived and its statistical and probabilistic properties are introduced and explored. This distribution is a two‐parameter extension of the Poisson distribution that generalizes some well‐known discrete distributions (Poisson, Bernoulli and geometric). It also leads to the generalization of distributions derived from these discrete distributions (i.e. the binomial and negative binomial distributions). We describe three methods for estimating the parameters of the Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution. The first is a fast simple weighted least squares method, which leads to estimates that are sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. The second method, using maximum likelihood, can be used to refine the initial estimates. This method requires iterations and is more computationally intensive. The third estimation method is Bayesian. Using the conjugate prior, the posterior density of the parameters of the Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution is easily computed. It is a flexible distribution that can account for overdispersion or underdispersion that is commonly encountered in count data. We also explore two sets of real world data demonstrating the flexibility and elegance of the Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution in fitting count data which do not seem to follow the Poisson distribution.}

  abstract = {Summary. Current demand for accountability and efficiency of healthcare organizations, combined with the greater availability of routine data on clinical care and outcomes, has led to an increased focus on statistical methods in healthcare regulation. We consider three different regulatory functions in which statistical analysis plays a vital role: rating organizations, deciding whom to inspect and continuous surveillance for arising problems. A common approach to data standardization based on (possibly overdispersed) Z-scores is proposed, although specific tools are used for assessing performance against a target, combining indicators when screening for inspection, and continuous monitoring using risk-adjusted sequential testing procedures. We pay particular attention to the problem of simultaneously monitoring over 200000 indicators for excess mortality, both with respect to the statistical issues surrounding massive multiplicity, and the organizational aspects of dealing with such a complex but high profile process.},

  abstract = {Objectives: A problem can arise when a performance indicator shows substantially more variability than would be expected by chance alone, since ignoring such “over-dispersion” could lead to a large number of institutions being inappropriately classified as “abnormal”. A number of options for handling this phenomenon are investigated, ranging from improved risk stratification to fitting a statistical model that robustly estimates the degree of over-dispersion. Design: Retrospective analysis of publicly available data on survival following coronary artery bypass grafts, emergency readmission rates, and teenage pregnancies. Setting: NHS trusts in England. Results: Funnel plots clearly show the influence of the method chosen for dealing with over-dispersion on the “banding” a trust receives. Both multiplicative and additive approaches are feasible and give intuitively reasonable results, but the additive random effects formulation appears to have a stronger conceptual foundation. Conclusion: A random effects model may offer a reasonable solution. This method has now been adopted by the UK Healthcare Commission in their derivation of star ratings.}
