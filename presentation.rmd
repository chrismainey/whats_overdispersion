# Count data

--

Rabe-Hesketh & Skondral (2012) suggest that 

>“Counts can be thought of as aggregated versions or summaries of more detailed data on the occurrences of some event.” 

Two common sources (Cameron and Trivedi, 2013e):
+  observation of point processes
+  discretization of continuous outcomes 

--

Several properties:

+ Natural, whole numbers (integers), sometimes referred to as ‘discrete.’ E.g. counts of 2 or 3 are possible, but 2.5 is not.

+ Range from zero to infinity, with counts less than zero impossible

+ Counts occur in a fixed time period, with a known average rate (𝜇)
  + counts that occur with a variable time period can be characterised as rates using a time denominator

+ Not normally distributed: Poisson.
  + Counts with low average rates are noticeable skewed
  + Asymptotically normally distributed when average rate is high


---
# Assumptions...

+ Even if you don't know you are doing it, using counts are simple Poisson models:
  + Characterised by it's average rate
  
+ Same holds for proportions/ratio which are commonly truncated Poisson distributions

+ Poisson assumptions commonly violated in, real world data (Breslow 184)

---
# Example: Hospital Readmissions

```{r nolimits}
# No limits
sub %>%
  group_by(Level, Trust=`Level description`) %>%
  summarise(Numerator = sum(Numerator),
            Expected = sum(Expected)) %>%
  # ggplot(aes(y=Numerator/Expected, x = Expected))+
  # geom_point() +
  # geom_hline(yintercept = 1, colour = "red")+
  # scale_y_continuous("Indirectly Standardised Readmission Ratio")+
  # scale_x_continuous(labels = comma)+
  funnel_plot(Numerator,Expected, Trust, data_type = "SR"
              , draw_adjusted = FALSE
              , draw_unadjusted = FALSE
             , title = "Readmissions 2021/22")

# Methods to deal with overdispersion

---

# 1. Ignore it...

Yes...that is an option....

--

Depends on what you are trying to do:

+ Poisson or Binomial model estimates are unbiased

+ Error will be wrong, but if using for prediction, it matters less.

---

# 2. Get more information...

Major causes of overdispersion are due to Poisson/Binomial models 

---

# 3. Characterise the variance better

Can apply computation methods to improve the accuracy, such as:

+ Boostrapping (Efron, 1979): taking random samples of you data and iteratively refitting, averaging across.
+ Scale the variance in a model
+ Scale the variance 'post-hoc' (after calculation) 
+ Use mixture models
+ Model known heirerachy e.g. clustering at trust level with random-intercept.


---

# 3a. Scaling the variance: quasi-models

---

# 3b. Mixture models

Negative Binomial


Generalised Poisson

Conway-Maxwell Poisson

# Common objections

> It's quite complicated.

Yes, it can be.  Main point is that your model is likely being too optimistic about it's error and you will be falsley assured of something by using it.

> We prefer the normal limits, as we don't want to miss anything

You can do, but your false positives are high.

> Doesn't look like much of a funnel anymore

This is because the additive overdispersion component is very large and dominating the new control limit.  This is exactly _why_ you need to account for it.

> Isn't it just picking how many outliers I want?

Well...sort of... yes.  If you have outliers, you investigate them first before changing the system.

> We can't tell which OD- adjustment method to chose...

Welcome to the wonderful world of Statistics. It's all shades of grey...

# Conclusions

+ We model and use count data all the time in healthcare analytics: even counting binary events.

+ Default assumptions for count data relate to Poisson and Binomial distributions, but these distributions have a very fixed expectation of the variance.

+ Real-world data is never as perfect as these distributions assume, so you usually underestimate the variance in your model, known as ___overdispersion___
